SPEC : 

General use and basic principles :

Each user has his own file storing each item he has, and if it is used, and what it is used for (XML)
Each item has its unique ID

When a user wants to request an item, he enters a "request [ID]" command. The programs find the user who has the item, and writes a request file, creating a request ID, commits it, and push it to the repo.
A notification system can be put in place by pulling modifications from the repo

A user can accept or deny a request by use a "request [--accept/--deny] [request ID]" command "request [--accept/--deny]" will accept/deny the last one. Accepting a request denies all pending requests for the same item.

Answering a request (manually or automatically) will delete the request file and create a response file, with its ID, remove the line corresponding to the item in the inventory, and put the item in a transfer file.

Once the requesting user gets the item, he uses the command "transfer [transfer ID]", deleting the tranfer file and adding the line to his inventory.

The files are written in XML.

IDs follow the UUID format, and as git, the first characters are sufficient if it leaves no ambiguity in the commands.
